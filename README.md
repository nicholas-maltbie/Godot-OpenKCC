# OpenKCC Addon

OpenKCC is a kinematic character controller library with components
written in C++ via [GDExtensions](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/gdextension/what_is_gdextension.html)

In order to use the project, the code must be compiled to binaries and exported
to the `lib` directory within the addon.
See [Project Setup](..\..\README.md#project-setup) and [Build](..\..\README.md#build)
for details on project setup and compiling the binaries.

The binaries are not included within the version controlled project and are only
included in the releases.
